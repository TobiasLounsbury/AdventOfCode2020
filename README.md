# AdventOfCode2020
These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2020.
All results timed on my daily driver laptop (i7 4760HQ) running Pop!OS 20.04

## Day 1:
For both problems I used roughly the same approach. To sort the data first because it would make it much faster to loop through if the assumption could be made that as soon as $a + $b was above the target you could break from that loop.
